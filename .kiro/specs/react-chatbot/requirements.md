# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a ReactJS chatbot application that displays a conversation interface with vertically scrolling messages between a user and an assistant. The application should provide an intuitive chat experience similar to modern messaging applications, allowing users to send messages and receive responses in a clean, organized interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a chat interface with my messages and assistant responses, so that I can have a conversation with the chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display an empty chat interface ready for interaction
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display the user's message in the chat area with appropriate styling
3. WHEN the assistant responds THEN the system SHALL display the assistant's message in the chat area with distinct styling from user messages
4. WHEN multiple messages are present THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order with the newest messages at the bottom

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see theorem prover facts alongside the chat interface, so that I can understand the logical context of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a theory section on the right side of the screen with filler text
2. WHEN the application is displayed THEN the system SHALL show chat messages on the left side and theory information on the right side
3. WHEN a user interacts with the separator THEN the system SHALL allow resizing between the chat and theory sections
4. WHEN the theory section is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain the layout proportions and usability of both sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to scroll through the conversation history, so that I can review previous messages in long conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat area contains more messages than can fit on screen THEN the system SHALL provide vertical scrolling functionality
2. WHEN new messages are added THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
3. WHEN a user manually scrolls up THEN the system SHALL maintain the scroll position until the user scrolls back down or a new message arrives
4. WHEN the chat area is scrolled THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to the chatbot, so that I can interact with the assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for typing messages
2. WHEN a user types in the input field THEN the system SHALL accept text input
3. WHEN a user presses Enter or clicks a send button THEN the system SHALL send the message and clear the input field
4. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate submissions and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want messages to be visually distinct between myself and the assistant, so that I can easily follow the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying user messages THEN the system SHALL align them to the right side with a distinct background color
2. WHEN displaying assistant messages THEN the system SHALL align them to the left side with a different background color from user messages
3. WHEN displaying any message THEN the system SHALL include appropriate padding, margins, and typography for readability
4. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL include timestamps or other metadata as needed for context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to respond to my messages, so that I can have an interactive conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL trigger a response from the assistant
2. WHEN the assistant is generating a response THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator or loading state
3. WHEN the assistant response is ready THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat interface
4. IF the assistant cannot respond THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and work on different screen sizes, so that I can use it on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
2. WHEN the application is viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the available screen space effectively
3. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality and readability
4. WHEN touch interactions are available THEN the system SHALL support touch-based scrolling and input
